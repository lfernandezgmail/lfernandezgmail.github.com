  <h1>Find the Bugs (Code With Bugs)</h1>
  <p>When first starting to use CSS students often have trouble getting their CSS to render. Bugs can happen because of
    many reasons:</p>
  <h3>Because of syntactical mistakes in the declaration block.</h3>
  <p>The most common syntactical mistakes are using a parenthesis instead of a curly brace. Or using a colon when a
    semi-colon is needed. Or vice versa. Or leaving off a semi-colon entirely. Or forgetting to close a rule-set with a
    closing brace. This last mistake will often corrupt css that is below it so it's especially costly</p>
  </p>
  <h3>Because of syntactical mistakes in a selector.</h3>
  <p> The most common syntactical mistakes in selectors are forgetting to put a "." in front of a class or a "#" in
    front of an id. Or inadvertently putting a "." or a "#" in the classname in the html.</p>
  <h3>Because the path in the link tag is wrong.</h3>
  <p>If nothing is styling most likely it's because your haven't coded the path 
    correctly in your link tag.

  <h2>Exercise:</h2>
  <p>Below this line is <a href="../bugged/index.html">unfixed CSS</a>. It should look like the pages on this <a
      href="../debugged/index.html">fixed version.</a> See if you can find the bugs:</p>

  <p class="urgent">This text should be red.</p>
  <p class="really-urgent">This text should be orange and twice the size of the red text.</p>
  <p id="most-urgent">This text should be orange and thrice the size of the red text</p>
  <p class="silver">This text should be silver</p>
  <p class="blue">This text should be blue</p>
  <p class="blue">This text should be blue</p>
