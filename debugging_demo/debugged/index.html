  <h1>Find the Bugs (Code With Bugs)</h1>
  <p>When first starting to use CSS students often have trouble getting their CSS to render.  Bugs can happen because of many reasons:</p>
  <p>Because of syntactical mistakes in the declaration block.  The most common syntactical mistakes are using a parenthesis instead of a curly brace.  Or using a colon when a semi-colon is needed. Or vice versa.  Or leaving off a semi-colon entirely. Or forgetting to close a rule-set with a closing brace.  This last mistake will often corrupt css that is below it so it's especially costly</p>
  <p>Because of syntactical mistakes in a selector.  The most common syntactical mistakes in selectors are forgetting to put a "." in front of a class or a "#" in front of an id.  Or inadvertently putting a "." or a "#" in the classname in the html.</p>
  <p>Because the path in the link tag is wrong.</p>
  <p>Below this paragraph the page should look like the pages on this <a href="../debugged/index.html">fixed version.</a>  See if you can find the bugs:</p>
  <p class="urgent">This text should be red.</p>
  <p class="really-urgent">This text should be orange and twice the size of the red text.</p>      
  <!-- The "#" was excised from most-urgent below -->
  <p id="most-urgent">This text should be orange and thrice the size of the red text</p>
  <p class="silver">This text should be silver</p>
  <p class="blue">This text should be blue</p>
  <p class="blue">This text should be blue</p>
