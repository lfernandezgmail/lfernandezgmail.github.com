<h1>Luke Fernandez' Main Github Web Page</h1>
  
<p>This Github site was mapped to demo.classyortrashy.com which I host through reclaimhosting.com.  
  To do that mapping I followed the instructions at: 
  <a href="https://community.reclaimhosting.com/t/domain-mapping-to-github/270">https://community.reclaimhosting.com/t/domain-mapping-to-github/270</a>
  </p>
  <p>
  I left out adding the CNAME file (with the text demo.classyortrashy.com) so that if I type in https://lfernandezgmail.github.io/ into the 
    browser it doesn't redirect to demo.classyortrashy.com
