<h3>Summary and Recommendations</h3>

<p>The KR<sub>20</sub> score for this test is 0.00. The Kuder-Richardson 20 Index is a measure of how homogeneous your test questions are
so a high KR<sub>20</sub> score means that you have likely obtained an accurate measure of the trait that the test is intended to quantify.<br>
The KR<sub>20</sub> score ranges from 0 to 1.  In general, tests with a reasonable amount of internal consistency will achieve a score of .60
or higher, while tests with high consistency achieve scores of .80 to .90.<br>
